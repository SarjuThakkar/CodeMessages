How To Play:

1. Gather your partner: Find a teammate who shares your passion for wordplay and espionage.
2. Roles: Decide who will be the spymaster and who will be the guesser. The spymaster provides one-word clues to guide the guesser in identifying the correct words. The spymaster will be the one to start the game and send the first message.
3. The Grid: A grid of word cards is laid out, representing red and blue agents, innocent bystanders, and the dangerous double-agent. Each team knows the secret identities of their agents (the words), but only the spymaster can see which color each card is. The colors are BLUE for the words your partner must guess. Red for the words the AI must guess. Black for the double-agent. And lastly off-white for bystanders.
4. Clue Time: The spymaster gives a one-word clue and a number, representing the connection between words and how many cards it applies to. For example, if the clue is "fruit" and the number is "2", it means there are two cards associated with the word "fruit."
5. Guessing: The guesser tries to identify the cards associated with the clue, selecting them one by one. The game confirms whether each card is an blue agent, red agent, innocent bystander, or the black card.
6. Agent Revealed: If the guesser selects a blue agent, their team gains a point and can continue guessing. If an innocent bystander or red agent is chosen, the turn ends. Choosing the black card ends the game, and the other team wins.
7. Strategy and Communication: As the game progresses, teams must carefully analyze the clues, the grid, and their opponents' choices. Effective communication is key to avoid the black card and uncover all their agents.
8. Winning: You and your partner must identify all of your blue agents to win before the AI red team guesses all their cards.
